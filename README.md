# _DDS_: Dummy DVFS Simulator

## ðŸ“™ Description

This Dummy DVFS Simulator has two functionalities:
1. CPU burner (`cpu_burner.cpp`)
2. LLM-mimicry simulator (`dummy_test.cpp`)

In the case of the CPU burner, it can lead to full utilization of the selected cores within a specified duration.
However, in the case of the LLM-mimicry simulator can lead to high CPU and RAM utilization.
